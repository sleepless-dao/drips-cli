# Radicle Grant Application

- **Project Name:** Drips CLI + SDK tutorial for node.js
- **Team Name:** Sleepless DAO
- **Payment Address:** 0x67678BA1e337C6E6F1D052b021B4d4dBa49eB2ad

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
This grant application consists of two components: 
1. Node.js module that enables opening a drip and "give" straight from the CLI. This module should extend the radicle cli. 
2. Drips SDK tutorial for node.js usage

Overall, this should increase the reach and usage of drips.network.

## Project Description :page_facing_up:
We want to make it easy for open source projects to get funding. That's why we want to make opening a drip just as easy as creating a git repo.

End goal: Fund radicle projects.

## Deliverables :nut_and_bolt:

Our objective is to increase the usage of drips.network.
- Our first deliverable is an extension of the radicle cli: create a drip & give straight from the CLI.
- Our second deliverable is a developer tutorial: how to use the drips sdk with node.js.

See the next steps section for our vision regarding further plans.

## Future Plans

- Make it possible to drip to a radicle project repo. 
- Integrate EPNS notifications into the flow, to facilitate developers' funding journey even more. As we've already started this part in the course of our ethAmsterdam hackathon, this seems a relevant next step for us.
- Part of our initial grant scope is to help developers with some tutorials to ensure their succesful onboarding. We intend to keep a close eye on this to make sure our initial CLI extension scope will be useful for developers. We could add some work streams regarding such adoption.

Enabling developers to get funding for their projects via the Drips Network through a series of developer tools integrations: CLI extensions (NPM packages), SDK tutorials, and potential for further integrations (such EPNS, for closing the loop)
