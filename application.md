# Radicle Grant Application

- **Project Name:** Drips funding developer package
- **Team Name:** Sleepless DAO
- **Payment Address:** TBC
- **[Level](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants#levels):** üå±-Seed

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- Developer tooling for facilitating project funding via Drips
- Enabling developers to get funding for their projects via the Drips Network through a series of developer tools integrations: CLI extensions (NPM packages), SDK tutorials, and potential for further integrations (such EPNS, for closing the loop)
- We would further increase the reach and usage of Drips Network, starting with extending the Radicle CLI
- After winning the Radicle sponsor prize at ETH Global hackathon, we've been discussing potential for further development with some Drips team members. Seeing the interest from both sides, we've decided to evaluate such grant opportunities to pursue our project further.

## Project Description :page_facing_up:

## Deliverables :nut_and_bolt:

Our objective is to extend the Drips Network usage by providing developer tools.
We will start by extending the Radicle CLI to enable developers to create Drips directly from their Radicle projects.
- A first deliverable will consist of extending the Radicle CLI by developing the method to create a Drip directly from the CLI.
- A second deliverable will consist of creating the NPM packages SDK tutorial, for facilitating first-hand adoption.

See the next steps section for our vision regarding further plans.

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
- **Full-time equivalent (FTE):** Amount of time (in days) required for a single person to complete this project ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent))
- **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment in USD for the whole project.

## Future Plans

Please include the following:

- After having successfully built the first Drip CLI extension (Radicle CLI), we'll look at extending other CLI environments
- A concrete next step that we would like to pursue after this first grant will be to integrate EPNS notifications into the flow, to facilitate developers' funding journey even more. As we've already started this part in the course of our ETH Global hackathon, this seems a relevant next step for us.
- Part of our initial grant scope is to help developers with some tutorials to ensure their succesful onboarding. We intend to keep a close eye on this to make sure our initial CLI extension scope will be useful for developers. We could add some work streams regarding such adoption.
