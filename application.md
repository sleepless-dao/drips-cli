### Team's experience

We won the radicle sponsor prize at ethAmsterdam hackathon with our [project](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethamsterdam/rad-drip-gx4jr).
Currently we are a team of four. Three developers and one PM.

We've been discussing potential for further development. Seeing the interest from both sides, we've decided to evaluate such grant opportunities to try to pursue this project further.

## Deliverables :nut_and_bolt:

Our objective is to increase the usage of drips.network.
- Our first deliverable is an extension of the radicle cli: create a drip & give straight from the CLI.
- Our second deliverable is a developer tutorial: how to use the drips sdk with node.js.

See the next steps section for our vision regarding further plans.

## Future Plans

Please include the following:

- After having successfully built the first Drip CLI extension (Radicle CLI), we'll look at extending other CLI environments
- A concrete next step that we would like to pursue after this first grant will be to integrate EPNS notifications into the flow, to facilitate developers' funding journey even more. As we've already started this part in the course of our ETH Global hackathon, this seems a relevant next step for us.
- Part of our initial grant scope is to help developers with some tutorials to ensure their succesful onboarding. We intend to keep a close eye on this to make sure our initial CLI extension scope will be useful for developers. We could add some work streams regarding such adoption.

Enabling developers to get funding for their projects via the Drips Network through a series of developer tools integrations: CLI extensions (NPM packages), SDK tutorials, and potential for further integrations (such EPNS, for closing the loop)
